This is a repository containing a clone of a game called SpaceX Falcon 9 Rocket Lander, created in Unity.

Unfortunately, due to only being able to spend Thursday and Friday on creating it, I have been unable to make exporting files to Android work correctly.
As such, my GameObjects that were supposed to be serialized from .json files are broken and the game is broken.
But it works fine in the Editor, and I assume it will work fine if it is provided with correct files on Android.
I'll fix that as soon as I get some sleep.

Thank you for reading.
